<h1>Hi üëã, I'm Aaron (Weixiang) Li, a full-stack software engineer :sparkles:</h1>

I hold a bachelor's degree from the University of California San Diego in Joint Mathematics and Economics, and a master's degree from the University of Washington in Computational Finance and Risk Management. Recently, in April 2023, I obtained a certificate in Software Engineering from General Assembly. My passion lies in solving complex coding problems and building robust applications. I have always been driven to exceed expectations, as evidenced by my portfolio of projects. I am eager to continue my growth in this field and push myself to new heights!
